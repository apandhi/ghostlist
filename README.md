=========

This library is currently a WIP. It was written for and used in the Queue+ mobile app (http://qplus.io/).

This library automatically removes DOM elements as they leave the viewport. This allows for a huge performance increase when using a Masonry layout. Instead of having to scroll with 2,000 DOM elements, your device will only have to scroll with 50 elements. 

##TODO 
 - Switch from iframes to a hashtable for the hidden DOM elements
 - Remove declared top css requirement
 - Remove unique ID requirement
